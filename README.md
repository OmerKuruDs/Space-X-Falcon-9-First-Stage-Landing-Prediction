# Space-X-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction

**Project Background and Context**

This project is part of the Applied Data Science Capstone course, designed to provide hands-on experience in applying data science techniques to solve real-world problems. The capstone involves the entire data science process, from data collection and cleaning to model development and evaluation.

The main objective of the project is to address a specific business or research problem using data-driven insights. By leveraging advanced analytics, machine learning, and data visualization tools, the project showcases how data science can contribute to informed decision-making and strategic planning.

Throughout the project, I utilized various tools and methods, including Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and machine learning algorithms, to build and validate models that solve the presented challenge. This practical approach demonstrates the significance of data science in addressing complex issues in today's data-rich environments.

**Executive Summary**

- Data Collection Methodology: Data was gathered from various sources, ensuring relevance and quality for the project. The methods used for data acquisition were carefully chosen to align with the research objectives.

- Data Wrangling: After collection, the data underwent a rigorous cleaning process to ensure accuracy and consistency. Missing values were handled, and any inconsistencies were resolved to prepare the dataset for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and SQL queries were employed to explore the data. Key trends, patterns, and correlations were identified to inform the next steps of the project.

- Interactive Visual Analytics: Tools such as Folium and Plotly Dash were used to create interactive visualizations that provided deeper insights into the data.

- Predictive Analysis: Machine learning models were developed, tuned, and evaluated to classify the data and predict outcomes with a high degree of accuracy.
